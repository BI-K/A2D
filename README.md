# Algorithm2Domain (A2D) 
## Work in progress
A2D is  a meta-repository for benchmarking of domain adaptation performance managed by [NFDI4DataScience](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/) consortium and the [Institute for Biomedical Informatics](https://bik.uni-koeln.de/) (University Hospital of Cologne).
Our goal is to aggregate existing algorithms and benchmarking suits, and develop integrative pipelines for mix-and-match cross-domain benchmarking. The data sources suitable for the benchmarking will be aggregated as pointers. 

## Wiki
In the [Wiki](https://github.com/BI-K/A2D/wiki) we aggregate knowledge regarding domain adaptation and related topics: generalizability, out-of-distribution performance etc., as well as different methods to improve the algorithm design and to efficiently adapt it to the new domain.
